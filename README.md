# Boutique Management System

A **C++ console-based Boutique Management System** developed using **functional programming concepts**. This academic project allows users to manage boutique inventory by adding, editing, deleting, viewing, and searching for items. The program includes three implementations:  
- Without Arrays  
- With Arrays  
- With Pointers  

It also demonstrates basic file handling for persistent storage.

---

## 💼 Key Features

- Add, Edit, Delete items
- View all stored items
- Search for an item by name
- File-based storage using text files
- Menu-driven interface
- Three modes of implementation:
  - Functional logic without arrays
  - Using arrays
  - Using pointers and structs

---

## 💡 Programming Concepts Applied

- Functional Programming in C++
- File Handling (`fstream`, `ifstream`, `ofstream`)
- Menu-Driven Structure using `switch` and `do-while`
- Basic use of Arrays and Pointers
- Struct-based data management in pointer mode

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++  
- **Concepts:** Functional Programming, File I/O, Arrays, Pointers  
- **IDE:** VS Code / Code::Blocks / Dev C++

## 📷 Sample Menu

***** How would you like to run this program? *****

Without Arrays

With Arrays

With Pointers

Exit


Each mode provides a full item management menu with options for:
- Add Item  
- Edit Item  
- Delete Item  
- View Items  
- Search Item  
- Exit

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- Data is saved in a file named `boutiqueeee.txt`.
- The "search" functionality currently checks against a local array (not actual file content).
- This program is intended for educational use only and is not a production-ready inventory system.
